# ehtim-tutorial

Tutorial for closure phase problem. List of files in this repository:
- `create_fits_images.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook for creating `.fits`
  files/`ehtim` images from image data
- `generating_measurements.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook for reading in `.fits`
  files and generating visibility and closure phase measurements. It also shows
  how to make some useful plots
- `arrays`: a directory containing telescope array files that define the
  telescopes you wish to observe with
- `data`: a directory containing a sample image we use for the tutorial
- `sample-run-pdfs`: a directory containing pdfs showing expected sample output
  from running the 2 notebooks
